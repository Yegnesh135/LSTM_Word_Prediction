## Next-Word Prediction with LSTM: Literature Edition
# Overview
Welcome to my next-word prediction project! I’ve developed an LSTM-based model to predict the next word in a sequence, trained on domain-specific literature data. This end-to-end solution showcases my expertise in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and deployment—delivering a creative and functional tool for text generation.

# Project Goals
**Next-Word Prediction**:     Accurately predict the next word in a sequence using a many-to-one LSTM architecture.
**Domain-Specific Training**: Leverage literature texts to capture stylistic and contextual nuances.
**Interactive Deployment**:   Provide a user-friendly interface via Streamlit for real-time predictions.
